        //        when to use string builder and buffer

//        The choice between  StringBuilder  and  StringBuffer  depends on the specific requirements
//        of your application.
//
//        1. Use  StringBuilder  when:
//        - You are working in a single-threaded environment.
//                - You need better performance and efficiency.
//                - Synchronization is not required.
//
//        2. Use  StringBuffer  when:
//        - You are working in a multi-threaded environment where thread safety is important.
//        - You need synchronization to ensure thread safety.
//        - Performance is less critical.
//
//    StringBuilder  is generally preferred over  StringBuffer  due to its better performance,
//    as it is not synchronized. However, if you are working in a multi-threaded environment
//    and require thread safety,  StringBuffer  should be used.
//
//    Here's an example illustrating the usage of  StringBuilder  and  StringBuffer :
//

        StringBuilder ssb = new StringBuilder();
        ssb.append("Hello");
        ssb.append(" World");
        String result1 = ssb.toString();

        StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();
        stringBuffer.append("Hello");
        stringBuffer.append(" World");
        String result2 = stringBuffer.toString();

//   Both  StringBuilder  and  StringBuffer  provide similar methods for string manipulation,
//   so you can use them interchangeably based on your specific requirements.
    }
